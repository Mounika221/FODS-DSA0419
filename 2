2. Scenario: You are a data analyst working for a company that sells products online. You have been tasked with analyzing the sales data for the past month. The data is stored in a NumPy array.
Question: How would you find the average price of all the products sold in the past month? Assume 3x3 matrix with each row representing the sales for a different product


import numpy as np
sales_data = np.array([
    [100, 200, 150],  # Product 1 sales
    [120, 210, 180],  # Product 2 sales
    [130, 220, 170]   # Product 3 sales
])
average_price = np.mean(sales_data)
print(f"The average price of all products sold in the past month is: ${average_price:.2f}")

OUTPUT:-
The average price of all products sold in the past month is: $164.44
