3. Scenario: You are working on a project that involves analyzing a dataset containing information about houses in a neighborhood. The dataset is stored in a CSV file, and you have imported it into a NumPy array named house_data. Each row of the array represents a house, and the columns contain various features such as the number of bedrooms, square footage, and sale price.
Question: Using NumPy arrays and operations, how would you find the average sale price of houses with more than four bedrooms in the neighborhood?


import numpy as np

house_data = np.array([
    [3, 2000, 300000],  # House 1
    [5, 2500, 500000],  # House 2
    [4, 1800, 350000],  # House 3
    [6, 3000, 600000],  # House 4
    [5, 2200, 450000]   # House 5
])
houses_with_more_than_four_bedrooms = house_data[house_data[:, 0] > 4]

average_sale_price = np.mean(houses_with_more_than_four_bedrooms[:, 2])

print(f"The average sale price of houses with more than four bedrooms is: ${average_sale_price:.2f}")


OUTPUT:-

The average sale price of houses with more than four bedrooms is: $516666.67
