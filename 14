14. Scenario: You are a data analyst working for a company that sells products online. You have been tasked with analyzing the sales data for the past month. The data is stored in a Pandas data frame. 

Question: Develop a code in python to find the frequency distribution of the ages of the customers who have made a purchase in the past month.



import pandas as pd





data = {

    'CustomerID': [101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108, 109, 110],

    'Age': [25, 30, 22, 25, 30, 40, 22, 35, 30, 25],

    'PurchaseAmount': [200, 150, 300, 450, 200, 500, 350, 600, 250, 400]

}





df = pd.DataFrame(data)





age_frequency = df['Age'].value_counts()





print("Frequency distribution of customer ages:")

print(age_frequency)
